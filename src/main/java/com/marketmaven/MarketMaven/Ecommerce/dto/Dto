Data transfer object is a design pattern used to transfer data between software applications subsystems.
Serves several important purposes:
1.Data encapsulation:it carries only neccesary address data between layers(eg controller to service)
2.security:prevents exposing sensitive internal details to external clients.
3.API Flexibality:Allows you to structure the data differently from your entity model.
4.Performance reduces network overhead by trand=sfering only req fields





These DTOs help maintain a clean separation between the database entities and the data that's exposed to the client,
while also providing a way to validate and structure data transfer.
